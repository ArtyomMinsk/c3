# Data visualization with c3.js

Assignment:

Given the two sets of data points below, plot both sets on the same graph (note the x values are the same) and display on a web page using d3 or another javascript library (but not using python libraries for the client web side).

Additionally, fit both sets of data points with a spline and plot the spline for both curves on the same graph.

Additionally, provide a combobox that contains the entries 'linear' and 'cubic'.  The user of the web page should be able to select either entry and redraw the spline curve using the selected approach for fitting the spline.

x = [590,540,740,130,810,300,320,230,470,620,770,250]
y = [32,36,39,52,61,72,77,75,68,57,48,48]

x1 = [590,540,740,130,810,300,320,230,470,620,770,250]
y1 = [28,39,41,35,72,82,68,66,45,59,38,28]
